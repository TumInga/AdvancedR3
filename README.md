DDEA Learning course R advanced 2 to 4 December 2025

# AdvancedR3:

This project is about understanding how to produce reproducibly R code,
using github and version control. Make a nice R-project so everyone
understands your code.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, docs and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: data used in this analysis (lipidomics.csv)
-   `docs/`: Documentation of this which could also contain comments
    from other co-authors
-   `R/`: Tested functions and R-code

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
