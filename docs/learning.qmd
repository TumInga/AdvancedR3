## Set up targets

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(targets)
tar_config_set(store=here::here("_targets"))
source(here::here('R/functions.R'))
lipodomics <- tar_read(lipidomics)
```

## Making a table

```{r}
lipodomics %>% 
  group_by(metabolite) %>% 
  summarise(across(value,list(mean=mean,sd=sd))) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric),\(x) round(x,digits=1))) %>% 
  mutate(across(-metabolite, num, digits = 1)) %>% 
  mutate(MeanSD = glue::glue('{value_mean} ({value_sd})')) %>% 
  select(Metabolite=metabolite,'Mean SD'=MeanSD) 

```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).

## This is poorly formatted

-   Definitely should have an empty space above this list.
-   This isn't a list, why not?
